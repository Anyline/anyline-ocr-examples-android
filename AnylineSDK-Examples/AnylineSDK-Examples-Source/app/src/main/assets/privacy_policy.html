<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>2. Personal data processed by Apps</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. There are also special categories of personal data such as health data, data related to political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or biometric data.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You are not obliged to provide personal data by statutory or contractual requirement. For downloading an App it is necessary to provide personal data. Many data capture use cases effectively require the processing of personal data. This means that you may not be able to digitize physical characters without processing of personal data (Art 13 para 2 (e) GDPR). However, if you use your device without internet connection the data processing will be performed on your device only. Except for Anyline Scanner (please see below) none of the Apps aims to process any special categories of personal data. If you decide to use an App to process any special categories of personal data, you explicitly consent to the processing of special categories of personal data. You may withdraw your consent at any time, which will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. To withdraw your consent please delete the App and do not longer use it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">2.1 Data processed during the download of an App</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For reasons of transparency please note that when you download an App from an app store the relevant app store (such as Google Play Store, Apple App Store) processes your account data such as your name, email address, account number, the time of the download or individual device identification numbers. Anyline is neither responsible for this processing nor does it receive any data.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">2.2 Data processed during the installation of an App</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Apps can be used without registration. Anyline (and its service providers) hardly ever receive personal data which is directly connected to an individual. Anyline does not know your name, telephone number or address. Personal data processed via Apps is linked to a so called UUID, which is an individual number which is unique for your device. Without any additional information neither Anyline nor its service providers may be able to identify you personally (pseudonymization and data protection by design and by default).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>4. Data transfers</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Anyline uses external service providers (e.g. for webhosting and our IT systems) who gain access to personal data. We carefully select our service providers and oblige them to process personal data only in accordance with our instructions and applicable data protection laws. If a service provider processes the data under its own responsibility, we take care to ensure that the transfer of personal data is kept to a minimum.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Anyline works with the following categories of recipients:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">File hosting service, cloud services, web application for error management, problem handling and operational project management, statistical service providers, IT development and support providers or the data protection officer. More precisely we work for example with Google Ireland Ltd, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, Ireland, for the creation of usage analyses with the help of the Google Analytics service.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Anyline strives to engage service providers based in the European Union or any country offering guarantees ensuring an adequate level of data protection essentially equivalent to that ensured within the European Union. Our server is located in Frankfurt, Germany. International service providers like Google, IBM or Atlassian transfer data also outside the European Union – with such service providers we conclude standard data protection clauses or investigate their binding corporate rules to ensure appropriate data protection safeguards for data transfers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>5. Data storage</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Personal data will be stored as long as it is required to provide the Apps. Within the Anyline Scanner you have the possibility to delete your scans in the rider “My Scans”. You can also uninstall or delete the App on your device to remove the locally stored random IDs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><br>
